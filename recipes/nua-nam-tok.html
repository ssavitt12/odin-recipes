    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Nua nam tok is a steak salad from the northeast of Thailand. The salad is
      mostly made of steak, with only fresh herbs and dressing added. It is
      typically served with sticky rice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nam tok literally translates to waterfall, referring to the juice falling
      from the meat when it is being grilled. Most of the obscure ingredients
      can be ordered online or found at a large Asian grocery store.
