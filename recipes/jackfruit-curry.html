    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>&frac12; oz dried red chilies</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>&frac12; chopped shallots</li>
      <li>2-3 teaspoons fermented shrimp paste</li>
      <li>1 cup halved cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>1 lb pork spare ribs, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1-2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 can young green jackfruit (20 oz)</li>
      <li>20 wild betel leaves</li>
      <li>1 cup Cha-om</li>
      <li>Jasmine rice for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Add the ribs to a large pot. Add the water and 1 tablespoon of the fish
        sauce and bring to a simmer over high heat. Then, lower the heat to
        maintain a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the same time, drain and rinse the jackfruit. Cut into small pieces
        and add them to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the ribs cook, make the curry paste. Grind the dried chilies into
        powder in a spice grinder and set aside. In a mortar and pestle, pound
        the garlic and shallots into a rough paste, combine with the chilies
        when the mixture feels wet. Once you have a rough paste, add the shrimp
        paste and pound to mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slim the top of the broth, and then add the curry paste. Stirk and mix
        while continuing to simmer until the pork is very tender. This should
        take 45 minutes to an hour depending on how thick the ribs are.
      </li>
      <li>Next, add the greens and tomatoes and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve alongside jasmine rice.</li>
      
    </ol>
